    "In this task, we implemented a Recommender Model based on **Matrix Factorization** algorithm. This model is used to recommend movies to users based on historical ratings data. In next sections we will discuss the dataset we used, approaches of Data Exploration, Data Preprocessing, Implementation and Optimization of the Model, and Experiments and Results.  "

The file ratings.csv contains 100836 ratings created by 610 users about 9742 movies; each line of this file below the header represents one rating of one movie(represented by movieId) by one user(represented by userId) and its timestamp. To make things easier, we only use the 3 columns: userId, movieId and rating. The following figure shows how the data looks like: "

    "## Algorithm for Recommandation\n",
    "We used **Matrix Factorization** for the recommender system. Matrix Factorization is a class of collaborative filtering algorithms. The algorithm attemps to decompose the rating matrix $R$ into the product of 2 lower dimensionality matrices U and M,  in which the users and items are represented in a lower dimensional latent space(K-dimensional Vector).  During the training process, the algorithm will try to minimize the loss function, which is presented by following formula:\n",
    "<center>$||R_{m,n}- U_{m,k}\\times M_{n,k}~T||^2+\\lambda (||U_{m, k}||^2 + ||M_{n, k}||^2)$ \n",

Because the parametres of the vectors of these users or movies are not trained before, it is unreliable to use the dot product of their vectors to calculate the ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We considered to check which Ids are missing in the training set after splitting the dataset into training set and test set and add some samples from test set to the training set. It seems that this method worked well but it can cause **Data Leakage**[5]; i.e. **Information from outside the training set is used to create the model, which can cause one to create overly optimistic if not completely invalid predictive models.**\n",

To find the optimal number of iterations, we need to monitor the value of cross-validation error during the training process. If the cross-validation error decreases with number of iterations increasing, we can improve the performance of the model by increasing iterations. If the cross-validation error starts to increase with the increasing of iterations, we should stop training the model. Therefore, the corresponding iteration of the minimal mse on test set during the process is considered as the optimal number of iterations(NOI). In the case of 5-Fold Cross Validation, we will find the optimal NOIs on 5 models and if one of them reaches the majority, i.e. 3 of 5, we will use this number as the optimal NOI of the model. If none of them reaches the majority, we will consider the second best NOI of the models and so on."

    "In the section Experiment & Result, we optimized the number of iterations and evaluate the model under the assumption of number of latent factors and learning rate. The result shows that the mse on test set is much larger than that on training set, which means there is overfitting. To prevent overfitting, we can increase the value of regularization parametre(rp) or decrease the number of latent factors."

    "In this assignment we finished implementing the recommender model based on Matrix Factorization algorithm and discussed the model optimization methods. In the future we will continue exploring and implementing the optimization method for number of latent factors and learning rate. Besides, to make the program more efficient, we are going to explore how to implement the algorithm concurrently and parallelly."
